* Software for One
** Minecraft
  "I don’t see myself as a real game developer. I make games because it’s fun, and because I love games and I love to program ... As soon as this deal is finalized, I will leave Mojang and go back to doing Ludum Dares and small web experiments. If I ever accidentally make something that seems to gain traction, I’ll probably abandon it immediately."
